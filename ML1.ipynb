    "\n",
    "Main Components in Machine Learning\n",
    "Data:\n",
    "The foundational component of any machine learning project. High-quality, relevant, and well-prepared data is essential for training accurate and reliable models. Data can be structured (e.g., tables, databases) or unstructured (e.g., text, images).\n",

    "Evaluation:\n",
    "After training, the model's performance is assessed using metrics appropriate for the task. For classification, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. For regression, metrics include mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.\n",

    "Hyperparameters:\n",
    "Hyperparameters are settings that must be defined before the training process begins. They control the behavior of the learning algorithm, such as learning rate, number of layers in a neural network, and regularization parameters. Hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimizing model performance.\n",
